# NAME

App::pq - Like jq and gq, but with Perl

# INSTALL

```bash
cpanm App::pq
```

# SYNOPSIS

With no arguments, dump the JSON data structure from STDIN as a Perl data structure.

```perl
$ echo '{"foo":[1,2,3],"bar":"blee"}' | pq
$VAR1 = {
          'bar' => 'blee',
          'foo' => [
                     1,
                     2,
                     3
                   ]
        };
```

With an argument, process the argument as code with $j as the perl data structure.

```
$ echo '{"foo":[1,2,3],"bar":"blee"}' | pq 'print join "\n",  keys %$j'
foo
bar
```
