=head1 NAME

App::pq - Like jq and gq, but with Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

With no arguments, dump the JSON data structure from STDIN as a Perl data structure.

    $ echo '{"foo":[1,2,3],"bar":"blee"}' | pq
    $VAR1 = {
              'bar' => 'blee',
              'foo' => [
                         1,
                         2,
                         3
                       ]
            };

With an argument, process the argument as code with $j as the perl data structure.

    $ echo '{"foo":[1,2,3],"bar":"blee"}' | pq 'print join "\n",  keys %$j'
    foo
    bar
